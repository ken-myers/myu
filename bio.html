        Hello! My name is Elijah Myers (also known as myu). I'm a nineteen year old, home based producer and songwriter from Denton, Texas. For my personal projects, I combine the intimacy and passion behind soft, indie, acoustic music with the other-worldly, cinematic sound from heavily produced electric music. I focus on creating songs that reshape and expand as they play out, taking people on a journey.

        I am never settled with my skill set, I am constantly looking to learn all that there is to the creation and release of projects. I spend my time diving deep into audio engineering, marketing, mixing & mastering, songwriting, and arrangement. I strive to perfect my craft in every aspect of the music industry.

        I am driven to make music by the emotional impact and human connection it brings. I believe that music is the closest existing thing to magic. All my life, music has provided me with indescribable, mind-altering, emotional experiences. The thought that I could provide such an experience to someone else and inspire them to do the same is the entire reason I do this.
