        Hello! My name is Elijah Myers. I am a nineteen-year-old songwriter, producer, and guitarist. I make music in order to create an unforgettable experience for a listener. Growing up I've had deep, personal connections with music. I vividly remember late night drives in highschool listening to affection by BETWEEN FRIENDS. I remember how it felt as if time stopped and the music consumed me entirely; nothing was real except me, the streetlights against the light-polluted night sky, and that song. The music created a genuine unforgettable experience, and I strive to recreate that–a song that connects with someone on a deep level.

        I release my own music under the name myu. Under that title, I make mostly electronic music and experiment in Ableton. Growing up I've always had an ear and appreciation for how songs were made. In elementary school I would listen to artists like Jeremy Zucker, The Chainsmokers, and Lauv out of fascination over the aspects of music that are only possible in post production (panning, vocal chopping, sampling etc.).  I would watch videos of artists explaining the process of making my favorite songs and think back to them when listening through my headphones in car rides. I am now inspired by the likes of Brakence and other hyper-pop artists that take production to a new, unheard of level of detail. My projects under myu are my attempt at creating songs with thorough care in the process of production, and to honor my love for the details.

        I am also the guitarist and sole producer for the band No Clue. My friends and I started this band in highschool out of our shared love for music. Due to lack of funds (and as an opportunity for me to learn), all songs for No Clue are recorded and produced out of my bedroom and a student practice room. Through this, I’ve gotten the invaluable experience of working with others to create pieces of art that we are all collectively proud of. Since my bandmates now all go to schools in separate cities and have school/work responsibilities, these projects were not easy to get done. Making the songs for the band is demanding, time-consuming, expensive, and overall draining. I love it.

    <p>I am proud of the work I have created. I hope for you to find a connection with it.</p>
