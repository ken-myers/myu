        Hello! My name is Elijah Myers (also known as myu). I'm a nineteen year old, home-based producer and songwriter from Denton, Texas. I like to combine the intimacy and passion behind soft, indie, acoustic music with the other-worldly, cinematic sound from heavily produced electric music. I focus on creating songs that reshape and expand as they play out, taking people on a journey.

        I have worked with Ableton since I was 11 years old, recorded and mixed live drums, worked with clients to produce songs of various genres, and I am currently studying music production at UNT. I am never settled with my skill set, I am constantly looking to learn all that there is to the creation and release of projects.

        I believe that music is the closest existing thing to magic. All my life, music has provided me with indescribable, mind-altering, emotional experiences. The thought that I could provide such an experience to someone else and inspire them to do the same is the entire reason I do this.
