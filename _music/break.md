title: take a break
description: |
 I started take a break on a trip to vegas with my dad. I remember working on it on the plane and trying to hear the music over the obnoxiously loud white noise. It was simple to make, everything fell together so perfectly. Synthmessing and take a break were the first myu tracks that I completed to my satisfaction. Putting them together under the same release and adding a seamless transition was something I felt was necessary since I began working on the tracks.
